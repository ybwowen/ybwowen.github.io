## Research

My research focuses on **robotics** and **vision–language–action (VLA) models**, with an emphasis on understanding how multimodal representations influence perception, action generation, and generalization in autonomous systems.

My broader technical interests include **SLAM**, **motion planning**, **sensor fusion**, **embedded systems**, and **robotic autonomy**, informed by extensive hands-on experience from **RoboMaster competitions**, where I earned **two consecutive national championships**.

At the **RethinkLab, Shanghai Jiao Tong University**, I work with **Prof. Junchi Yan** and **Asst. Prof. Xiaosong Jia** on representation alignment and mechanism interpretability in VLA-based robotic systems.

  <p class="project-desc">
    I study latent-space misalignment between action tokens and vision–language perception embeddings in VLA models. 
    My current work proposes an external feature distillation framework that injects structured priors to improve representational coherence and interpretability. 
    A manuscript is in preparation for <strong>Robotics: Science and Systems (RSS) 2026</strong>.

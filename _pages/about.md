a junior undergraduate student at Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Paris Elite Institute of Technology, majoring in Information Engineering and French. I have the privilege of working with Prof. [Junchi Yan](https://thinklab.sjtu.edu.cn/) and Asst. Prof. [Xiaosong Jia](https://jiaxiaosong1002.github.io/).

I am set to graduate in June 2027 and am actively seeking research intern oppotunities.

## Research

My research focuses on **robotics** and **vision–language–action (VLA) models**, with an emphasis on understanding how multimodal representations influence perception, action generation, and generalization in autonomous systems.

My broader technical interests include **SLAM**, **motion planning**, **sensor fusion**, **embedded systems**, and **robotic autonomy**, informed by extensive hands-on experience from **RoboMaster competitions**.

At the **RethinkLab, Shanghai Jiao Tong University**, I work with **Prof. Junchi Yan** and **Asst. Prof. Xiaosong Jia** on representation alignment and mechanism interpretability in VLA-based robotic systems.

### Ongoing Work
**Representation Matters: Vision–Language–Action Alignment for Robotics**  
Research Assistant, RethinkLab, SJTU (Sep 2025 – Present)  
I study latent-space misalignment between action tokens and vision–language perception embeddings in VLA models. My current work proposes an external feature distillation framework that injects structured priors to improve representational coherence and interpretability. A manuscript is in preparation for **Robotics: Science and Systems (RSS) 2026**.
